Hello! This is my great big pit of java/c/shell/web/etc projects, under construction ad infinitum! 

  > [!note]
> A few things I'm working on...
> - a historically accurate Ottoman-era cannoneering game
> - bunch of silly lil' web tools
> - multiplayer ~~gambling~~ card n' dice game
> - a few tiny SNES/GBC/DS romhacks
> - the YUMP project!

And yes, also an ardent supporter of _you_ — yes, you, ya lovely human being! (୨୧ ❛ᴗ❛)✧
