> _hiya!_ (〃'▽'〃)/

Hello — this is my great big pit of java/c/shell/web/etc projects, under construction ad infinitum! 

Note that many repos are presently empty, as most are ideas I draft and hope to later build upon; I focus on smaller projects encompassing everyday use-cases and a wide topic range in the hopes of **accruing universal skills** and **sculpting creative software I intend to realistically use.**

  > [!note]
> Some current projects...
> - historically accurate Ottoman-era cannoneering game
> - assortment of small web experiences
> - https://solfleur.systems and assorted tools
> - a few tiny SNES/GBC/DS romhacks
> - experiential ruby / rust / react / electronics / networking personal projects for learning
> - tiny Mac productivity apps (corkboard, LaTeX editor, etc.)
> - the YUMP project

And yes, also an ardent supporter of _you_ — yes, you, ya lovely human being! (୨୧ ❛ᴗ❛)✧
